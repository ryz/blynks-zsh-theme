# blynks-zsh-theme

![](https://raw.github.com/ryz/blynks-zsh-theme/master/blynks-zsh-theme-iterm.png)

A modified blinks ZSH theme. This is my customized Blinks theme that comes with the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework.

Changes:
  * Show the vi-mode on the right side of the prompt
  * Slightly slimmed down prompt
  * Some colors have been changed

## Installation
Clone this repo, copy the blynks.zsh-theme file into your $ZSH\_CUSTOM directory and set your theme to blynks in your .zshrc.
